encourage our young readers to make use of the library during the vacations. The library will
 be open from Mondayto Saturday from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm during vacations (April 17th to June 5th 2010).
 Children can read in the library from 9:00 am to 1:00 pm, with their parents. Twobooks ONLY
 (not reference books) can be issued on the child’s name, at a time for home reading. It should be returned 
on the due date. All rules of the library have to be followed, including payment of fines. Silence should 
be maintained in the library.

    &nbsp;<strong>June 7, 2015 </strong><br />Dear Parents,
       <font>
 The holiday season has come to an end and some of
            you must have had a hectic travel schedule; I am sure like us you too are looking
            forward to the children resuming the school.However we at school have often seen that there
                is a tendency amongst the parents that despite the children suffering from minor
                ailment due to fatigue jet lag, they are sent to school, least realizing that this
                affects the health of other children too.While we welcome back the children
    with open arms, we advise you to kindly refrain from sending children to school
    if they suffer from minor contagious ailments such as fever, cough, cold, pain abdomen,
    vomiting and diarrhea etc.Looking forward to your cooperation.</font><span style="font-size: 16pt"><font size="3">&nbsp;<br />
